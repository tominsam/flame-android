Flame is a Zeroconf network services browser. It's also an application that
I tend to port to a lot of platforms as something simple that will let me get
a feel for the thing. So this is the Android one. Or rather it's a VERY ROUGH
OUTLINE of something that might become an Android version of flame. It's entirely
non-functional right now. I also suspect that [this bug](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2323)
might make it impossible to write at the moment. We shall see.
